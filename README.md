It's a simple application that you can use to learn a litle bit about Vue.js 

I used some CND and resources like JSONPlaceholder (to get some fake data):

* https://unpkg.com/vue@2.2.4 (Vue.js 2.x)
* https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue-resource/1.2.1/vue-resource.min.js (Vue Resource)
* https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css (Bootstrap 3.3.x)

It's good idea you fork this repository, make changes and send a pull request.
